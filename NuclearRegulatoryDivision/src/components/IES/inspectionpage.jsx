      The PNRI imposes enforcement actions to licensees who are found to have violated any 
      rule or regulation issued by the PNRI.   These enforcement actions are issued in the form of:
      </p>

      <p className="p-5 text-2xl font-bold">
       (a) Notice of Violation
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl">A Notice of Violation is a written notice that sets forth one or more violations to PNRI 
      requirements and requires the licensee to submit a written reply containing: </p>

      <p className="text-xl ">(1) An explanation why or how the violation occurred or, if contested, the basis for 
      disputing the violation; </p>

      <p className="text-xl">(2) Corrective actions that have been taken and the results achieved;</p>

      <p className="text-xl">(3) Corrective actions to be taken to prevent recurrence; and</p>

      <p className="text-xl">(4) The date when full compliance will be achieved.</p>

      <p className="p-5 text-2xl font-bold">(b) Orders </p>
      <p className="text-xl">An <b>ORDER</b> is a written PNRI directive to modify, suspend, or revoke a license; to cease and  
        desist from a given practice or activity; or to take such other action as may be proper.  </p>
        
      <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify">Orders are also used when the PNRI has identified deliberate misconduct that may 
        cause a licensee to violate a PNRI requirement, or where incomplete or inaccurate information 
        is deliberately submitted, or where the PNRI is not assured that the licensee, or any of its 
        authorized personnel, will meet PNRI requirements.</p>

      <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify">Orders may also be issued as appropriate for 
        Severity levels I, II, or III violations, as follows:</p>

      <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify"><b>(1) License Modification Orders</b> are issued when change in licensee equipment, 
        procedures, personnel or management controls are necessary. This type of 
        Order may be issued by reason of addition or withdrawal of specific authority in 
        the license, or amendment of rules or regulations, or as a result of a 
        determination of a significant violation requiring such directive. </p>

       
        <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify"><b>(2) Suspension Orders</b> may be used:</p>
           <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8">(i) To remove a threat to public health 
            and safety, security of radioactive sources,  the environment or the national interest; </p>

           <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-5 mb-3">(ii) To stop the construction of a facility when:</p>
                     <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-20">- Further work could preclude or significantly hinder the identification or 
                      correction of an improperly constructed safety-related system or component; or </p>
                     <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-20">- The licensee's quality assurance program implementation 
                      is not adequate to  provide confidence that construction activities are being properly carried out; </p>
        
           <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-3">(iii) When the licensee has not responded adequately to a previous enforcement action;</p>

           <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-3">(iv) When the licensee interferes with the conduct of an inspection or investigation; or </p>
           
           <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-3">(v) For any reason not mentioned above for which license suspension is legally  authorized under Section 27 of RA 5207 </p>

           <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify"><b>(3) Cease and Desist Orders</b> may be used to stop an unauthorized or unsafe 
           activity that has continued after notification by the PNRI that the activity is 
           unauthorized or unsafe, and/or a suspension order has not been followed. </p>

           <p className="text-xl text-justify mt-5"><b>(4) Revocation Orders</b> may be used:</p>
            <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-3">(i)When a licensee refuses to correct a violation; </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-3">(ii)When a licensee does not respond to a Notice of Violation where a 
            response  was required;  </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-3">(iii)When a licensee refuses to pay any prescribed fee under the PNRI 
            regulations; or  </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-justify ml-8 mt-3">(v)For any other reason for which revocation is authorized under Section 27 
              of the Atomic Energy Regulatory and Liability Act of 1958, “R.A No. 5207”.  </p>

              <p className="p-5 text-2xl font-bold">
               (c) Administrative Sanctions </p>
               <p className="text-xl text-justify">In addition to Notices of Violations and Orders, the PNRI also uses administrative 
                regulatory actions, such as Confirmatory Action Letters, Letters of Reprimand, and Demand for 
                Information to supplement its enforcement program. The PNRI expects licensees to adhere to any 
                obligations and commitments resulting from these actions and will not hesitate to issue 
                appropriate Orders and/or sanctions to ensure that these obligations and commitments are met. </p>

                <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify"><b>(1) Confirmatory Action Letters</b> are letters confirming a licensee's agreement to 
                take certain actions to remove significant concerns about health and safety or 
                the environment.  </p>

           <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify"><b>(2) Letters of Reprimand</b> are letters addressed to individuals named in the license 
           identifying a significant deficiency in their performance of licensed activities.</p>

           <p className="mt-5 text-xl text-justify"><b>(3) Demand for Information</b>  are demand letters to the licensee for information for 
           the purpose of enabling the PNRI to determine whether or not an order or other 
           enforcement action should be issued. </p>

           <p className="text-xl text-justify mt-5">Some mechanisms employed by the PNRI to aid enforcement are regulatory conferences 
            with licensees and issuance of regulatory bulletins or information notices. Regulatory conferences 
            are meetings organized by the PNRI with licensee management to discuss safety, security or 
            environmental issues, licensee's compliance with regulatory requirements, licensee's proposed 
            corrective measures and enforcement options available to the PNRI. Regulatory bulletins or 
            information notices are written notifications to licensees identifying specific problems and 
            recommending specific actions. </p>
